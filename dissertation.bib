  abstract = {This final chapters deals with the evaluation of the collaborative planning scheme developed in chapters 4 and 5 by computational tests. The purpose is to determine the quality of solutions attainable with the scheme on the one hand and the computational efforts necessary for realizing these solutions on the other. The focus of the computational analysis is on the basic version of the scheme as described in chapter 4, i.e. one-time planning between a single buyer and supplier. However, a somewhat smaller number of tests also considers a more general SC structure with a single supplier but several buyers, as well as planning on a rolling basis between two SC partners.},
